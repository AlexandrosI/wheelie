#wheelie

Project WHEELIE.

We will create a spinning wheel game. The user will spin the wheel and will receive a movie recommendation from IMDB database.
When the page loads the user will be presented with few filters.  (ex. movie type, year of release)
Next, the user will spin a wheel. The wheel will be divided into 12 parts. Each part will represent a movie recommendation
The spinning wheel will retrieve  - filtered - movie recommendations from IMDB database.
